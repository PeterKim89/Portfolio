## Introduction
A portfolio is an integral part to any developer's success. While it is nice to look back and see how much our skills have developed across projects. A well built portfolio will be one of the main things employers will also see. As time goes on, this portfolio will grow alongside my skills as a programmer and developer.

## Build Process
- Read the user story and acceptance criterias
- View the attached demo portfolio to better understand the challenge
- Begin by writing pseudocode and an abstract website framework
- Create a skeleton of the HTML
- Add semantic tags to the HTML while also filling in structural elements
- Create the style.css with basic elements and possible classes to be used
- Once initial versions of both files are done, begin refactoring them both
- Add comments throughout both files
